# Colour Schemes

Hi there! My name's Dayle Rees and I'm one of the Laravel PHP framework core developers. Part of the Laravel mentality is that coding should be enjoyable for the coder, not just the client receiving your hard work. For this reaon I'd like to share with you a number of themes for some popular text editors that will hopefully be pleasing to your eyes, and allow you to enjoy the time you spend in front of the screen.

The themes in this package are currently compatible with Sublime Text 2, Textmate, VIM and a whole bunch of Java editors that use the IntelliJ scheme engine like PHPstorm! I hope to add more editors in the near future.

## Installation

### Sublime Text 2

For the sublime text 2 editor the themes can be installed easily by using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install the 'Dayle Rees Color Schemes' package from the official repository.

Otherwise, first find your Sublime Text 2 packages directory, you can find this by using the `Preferences -> Browse Packages` menu from within Sublime Text 2.

Now either create a `daylerees - themes` folder within this directory, and copy the contents of the github repository inside, or clone the repo using the GIT software within the packages directory :

	git clone https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes.git daylerees-themes

Now simply use the `Color Schemes` option of your preferences menu to switch between themes, enjoy!

### TextMate 1.5.x

Clone the repository and copy the theme files into `~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes/`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes.git daylerees-themes
    $ cd daylerees-themes
    $ mkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes/
    $ cp *.tmTheme ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes/

### Textmate 2

Clone the repository and copy the theme files into `~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Themes.tmbundle/Themes/`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes.git daylerees-themes
    $ cd daylerees-themes
    $ cp *.tmTheme ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/Themes.tmbundle/Themes/

Note that you cannot clone the repository into the Themes directory -- as of this writing TextMate 2 will not recursively scan subdirectories searching for themes. Also note that you cannot symlink the themes into the Themes directory either -- TextMate will hang attempting to process them.

### VIM

Download or clone with git, the themes into your `.vim/colors` directory. Now edit your `.vimrc` file and add the following line.

	colorscheme <scheme-name-here>

Save and launch vim to use, enjoy!

### IntelliJ

See the documentation for your editor, this varies between each one!
